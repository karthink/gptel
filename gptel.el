;;; Commentary:

;; gptel is a simple Large Language Model chat client, with support for multiple
;; models and backends.
;;
;; It works in the spirit of Emacs, available at any time and in any buffer.
;;
;; gptel supports:
;;
;; - The services ChatGPT, Azure, Gemini, Anthropic AI, Together.ai, Perplexity,
;;   AI/ML API, Anyscale, OpenRouter, Groq, PrivateGPT, DeepSeek, Cerebras, Github Models,
;;   GitHub Copilot chat, AWS Bedrock, Novita AI, xAI, Sambanova, Mistral Le
;;   Chat and Kagi (FastGPT & Summarizer).
;; - Local models via Ollama, Llama.cpp, Llamafiles or GPT4All
;;
;; Additionally, any LLM service (local or remote) that provides an
;; OpenAI-compatible API is supported.
;;
;; Features:
;;
;; - Interact with LLMs from anywhere in Emacs (any buffer, shell, minibuffer,
;;   wherever).
;; - LLM responses are in Markdown or Org markup.
;; - Supports conversations and multiple independent sessions.
;; - Supports tool-use to equip LLMs with agentic capabilities.
;; - Supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration using the mcp.el package.
;; - Supports multi-modal models (send images, documents).
;; - Supports "reasoning" content in LLM responses.
;; - Save chats as regular Markdown/Org/Text files and resume them later.
;; - You can go back and edit your previous prompts or LLM responses when
;;   continuing a conversation.  These will be fed back to the model.
;; - Redirect prompts and responses easily
;; - Rewrite, refactor or fill in regions in buffers.
;; - Write your own commands for custom tasks with a simple API.
;;
;; Requirements for ChatGPT, Azure, Gemini or Kagi:
;;
;; - You need an appropriate API key.  Set the variable `gptel-api-key' to the
;;   key or to a function of no arguments that returns the key.  (It tries to
;;   use `auth-source' by default)
;;
;; ChatGPT is configured out of the box.  For the other sources:
;;
;; - For Azure: define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-azure', which see.
;; - For Gemini: define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-gemini', which see.
;; - For Anthropic (Claude): define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-anthropic',
;;   which see.
;; - For AI/ML API, Together.ai, Anyscale, Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Cerebras or
;;   Github Models: define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-openai', which see.
;; - For PrivateGPT: define a backend with `gptel-make-privategpt', which see.
;; - For Perplexity: define a backend with `gptel-make-perplexity', which see.
;; - For Deepseek: define a backend with `gptel-make-deepseek', which see.
;; - For Kagi: define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-kagi', which see.
;;
;; For local models using Ollama, Llama.cpp or GPT4All:
;;
;; - The model has to be running on an accessible address (or localhost)
;; - Define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-ollama' or `gptel-make-gpt4all',
;;   which see.
;; - Llama.cpp or Llamafiles: Define a gptel-backend with `gptel-make-openai'.
;;
;; Consult the package README for examples and more help with configuring
;; backends.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; gptel can be used in any buffer or in a dedicated chat buffer.  The
;; interaction model is simple: Type in a query and the response will be
;; inserted below.  You can continue the conversation by typing below the
;; response.
;;
;; To use this in any buffer:
;;
;; - Call `gptel-send' to send the buffer's text up to the cursor.  Select a
;;   region to send only the region.
;;
;; - You can select previous prompts and responses to continue the conversation.
;;
;; - Call `gptel-send' with a prefix argument to access a menu where you can set
;;   your backend, model and other parameters, or to redirect the
;;   prompt/response.
;;
;; To use this in a dedicated buffer:
;; 
;; - M-x gptel: Start a chat session.
;;
;; - In the chat session: Press `C-c RET' (`gptel-send') to send your prompt.
;;   Use a prefix argument (`C-u C-c RET') to access a menu.  In this menu you
;;   can set chat parameters like the system directives, active backend or
;;   model, or choose to redirect the input or output elsewhere (such as to the
;;   kill ring or the echo area).
;;
;; - You can save this buffer to a file.  When opening this file, turn on
;;   `gptel-mode' before editing it to restore the conversation state and
;;   continue chatting.
;;
;; - To include media files with your request, you can add them to the context
;;   (described next), or include them as links in Org or Markdown mode chat
;;   buffers.  Sending media is disabled by default, you can turn it on globally
;;   via `gptel-track-media', or locally in a chat buffer via the header line.
;; 
;; Include more context with requests:
;;
;; If you want to provide the LLM with more context, you can add arbitrary
;; regions, buffers, files or directories to the query with `gptel-add'.  To add
;; text or media files, call `gptel-add' in Dired or use the dedicated
;; `gptel-add-file'.
;;
;; You can also add context from gptel's menu instead (`gptel-send' with a
;; prefix arg), as well as examine or modify context.
;;
;; When context is available, gptel will include it with each LLM query.
;;
;; LLM Tool use:
;;
;; gptel supports "tool calling" behavior, where LLMs can specify arguments with
;; which to call provided "tools" (elisp functions).  The results of running the
;; tools are fed back to the LLM, giving it capabilities and knowledge beyond
;; what is available out of the box.  For example, tools can perform web
;; searches or API lookups, modify files and directories, and so on.
;;
;; Tools can be specified via `gptel-make-tool', or obtained from other
;; repositories, or from Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers using the mcp.el
;; package.  See the README for details.
;;
;; Tools can be included with LLM queries using gptel's menu, or from
;; `gptel-tools'.
;;
;; Rewrite interface
;;
;; In any buffer: with a region selected, you can rewrite prose, refactor code
;; or fill in the region.  This is accessible via `gptel-rewrite', and also from
;; the `gptel-send' menu.
;;
;; Presets
;;
;; Define a bundle of configuration (model, backend, system message, tools etc)
;; as a "preset" that can be applied together, making it easy to switch between
;; tasks in gptel.  Presets can be saved and applied from gptel's transient
;; menu.  You can also include a cookie of the form "@preset-name" in the prompt
;; to send a request with a preset applied.  This feature works everywhere, but
;; preset cookies are also fontified in chat buffers.
;;
;; gptel in Org mode:
;;
;; gptel offers a few extra conveniences in Org mode:
;;
;; - You can limit the conversation context to an Org heading with
;;   `gptel-org-set-topic'.
;;   
;; - You can have branching conversations in Org mode, where each hierarchical
;;   outline path through the document is a separate conversation branch.
;;   See the variable `gptel-org-branching-context'.
;;   
;; - You can declare the gptel model, backend, temperature, system message and
;;   other parameters as Org properties with the command
;;   `gptel-org-set-properties'.  gptel queries under the corresponding heading
;;   will always use these settings, allowing you to create mostly reproducible
;;   LLM chat notebooks.
;;
;; Finally, gptel offers a general purpose API for writing LLM ineractions that
;; suit your workflow.  See `gptel-request', and `gptel-fsm' for more advanced
;; usage.

The preview-setup function is called with two arguments: a list of the
corresponding tool call arguments and the request INFO plist.  It must
set up the preview for the tool call and return a handle to the preview,
which can be any object, but typically an overlay or a buffer.

The preview-setup can integrate with gptel's default previewer by
inserting at point (and moving point), or use a different preview method
entirely.

The preview-teardown function, if provided, is called with this handle
when the tool call is accepted or rejected, and it must clear the
preview.

  "Define a gptel preset with NAME.

A preset is a combination of gptel options intended to be applied and
used together.  Presets can make it less tedious to change gptel
settings on the fly.

Typically this will include a model, backend, system message and perhaps
some tools, but any set of gptel options can be set this way.

NAME must be a symbol.  KEYS is a plist corresponding to the options
being set.  All KEYS are optional.

Recognized keys:

DESCRIPTION is a description of the preset, used when selecting a
preset.

PARENTS is a preset name (or list of preset names) to apply before this
one.

PRE and POST are functions to run before and after the preset is
applied.  They take no arguments.

BACKEND is the `gptel-backend' to set, or its name (like \"ChatGPT\").

MODEL is the `gptel-model', a symbol.

SYSTEM is the directive.  It can be
- the system message (a string),
- a list of strings (a conversation template)
- or a function (dynamic system message).
- It can also be a symbol naming a directive in `gptel-directives'.

TOOLS is a list of gptel tools or tool names, like
\\='(\"read_url\" \"read_buffer\" ...)

Recognized keys are not limited to the above.  Any other key (like
`:foo') corresponds to the value of either `gptel-foo' (preferred) or
`gptel--foo'.
- So TOOLS corresponds to option `gptel-tools',
- CONFIRM-TOOL-CALLS to `gptel-confirm-tool-calls',
- TEMPERATURE to `gptel-temperature' and so on.
See gptel's customization options for all available settings.

Specifying the value of a key will set the corresponding gptel option to
it.  For example,

    :system \"Use the provided tools to search the web
              for up-to-date information\")

will replace the currently active option `gptel-tools' and the system
message.

Alternatively,

- You can require that the value be appended or prepended to the
  existing value instead of replacing it.  This can be done by
  specifying the value as a plist instead with the keys `:prepend' or
  `:append'.

  (gptel-make-preset \\='websearch
    :tools  \\='(:append (\"search_web\" \"read_url\"))
    :system \\='(:prepend \"Use the provided tools to search the web
                        for up-to-date information.\"))

- You can dynamically compute the value for a key at the time the preset
  is applied with `:eval' or `:function'.  This is mostly useful when
  using presets in the prompt, as @preset-name.

  An `:eval' form is evaluated when the preset is applied:

  (gptel-make-preset \\='visible-buffers
    :description \"Include the full text of all buffers visible in the
                 frame.\"
    :context \\='(:eval (mapcar #\\='window-buffer (window-list))))
    ▲                ▲
    │                ╰╴evaluated when preset is applied
    ╰╴sets `gptel-context'

  `:function' should take the current value of the key as an input and
  return the new value.  Here we combine it with `:append' in the plist.

  (gptel-make-preset \\='github-read-only
    :description \"Provide read-only GitHub tools\"
    :pre (lambda () (gptel-mcp-connect \\='(\"github\") \\='sync))
    :tools
    \\='( :append (\"mcp-github\")       ;Adds all github MCP tools
       :function (lambda (tools)
                   (cl-delete-if    ;Remove \"write\" access to GitHub
                    (lambda (tool)
                      (string-match-p \"create_\" (gptel-tool-name tool)))
                    tools))))

  NOTE: `:eval' and `:function' are evaluated in a temporary buffer, and
  not the buffer from which the request is sent."
