;;; Commentary:

;; LLM querying library used by gptel.  This file provides the basic data
;; structures (models, backends) and prompt construction functions used by
;; gptel, along with the `gptel-request' API.
;;
;; This is everything required to use `gptel-request' to write custom commands,
;; UIs or packages that use gptel to implement custom workflows.  To use gptel's
;; LLM querying API, you can
;;
;; (require 'gptel-request)
;;
;; and make calls to `gptel-request'.
;;
;; Note that this file does not provide any of the UI components used by gptel
;; (chat buffers, tool use prompts, transient menus), nor does it provide the
;; default response callbacks used by `gptel-request'.  You will need to provide
;; your own callback to `gptel-request' to act on the LLM response, or require
;; the larger `gptel' feature.

Specifies the size threshold for when to use a temporary file to pass data to
Curl in gptel queries.  If the size of the data to be sent exceeds this
threshold, the data is written to a temporary file and passed to Curl using the
`--data-binary' option with a file reference.  Otherwise, the data is passed
directly as a command-line argument.

The value is an integer representing the number of bytes.

Adjusting this value may be necessary depending on the environment
and the typical size of the data being sent in gptel queries.
A larger value may improve performance by avoiding the overhead of creating
temporary files for small data payloads, while a smaller value may be needed
if the command-line argument size is limited by the operating system.

  "Handlers to augment or transform a query before sending it.

This hook is called in a temporary buffer containing the text to
be sent, with the cursor at the end of the prompt.  You can use
it to modify the buffer or buffer-local variables as required.

Since these functions modify the prompt construction buffer, the order
in which they run is significant!  In particular, you may want to add
your function before (the default) or after
`gptel--transform-add-context', which adds gptel's context (other
buffers, files etc) to this buffer.

Example: A typical use case might be to search for occurrences of $(cmd)
and replace it with the output of the shell command cmd, making it easy
to send the output of shell commands to the LLM.

Transform functions can be synchronous or asynchronous.

Synchronous hook functions must accept zero or one argument: the INFO
plist for the current request.

Asynchronous hook functions must accept two arguments: a callback to
call after the transformation is complete, and the INFO plist for the
current request.

Note that while this set of handlers can certainly be set with a global
value to be applied to all queries in all buffers, it meant to be set
locally for a specific buffer, or chat topic, or only the context of a

A \"directive\" is typically the system message (also called

expectations and the overall tone.

gptel's idea of the directive is more general.  A directive in

- A string, interpreted as the system message.

- A list of strings, whose first (possibly nil) element is
  interpreted as the system message, and the remaining elements
  as (possibly nil) alternating user prompts and LLM responses.
  This can be used to template the initial part of a conversation.

- A function that returns a string or a list of strings,

  generate a system message and/or conversation template based on

  "List of gptel's context sources.

The items in this list (file names or buffers) are included with gptel
queries as additional context.

Each entry can be a file path (string) or a buffer (object, not buffer
name):

 \\='(\"~/path/to/file1\"
   \"./file2\"
   #<buffer *scratch*>
   ...)

The above covers the most common cases.  You can also specify context
sources in a more targeted way, with entries of the form

  (<buffer> . spec)
  (\"/path/to/file\" . spec)

where spec is a plist declaring specific parts of the buffer/file to
include instead of the entire text.

For buffers, you can specify regions to include using buffer spans and
line number ranges as conses, and overlays as a list:

  (<buffer> :bounds ((start1 . end1) (start2 . end2) ...)
            :lines  ((from1 . to1) (from2 . end2) ...)
            :overlays (ov1 ov2 ...))

For files, spec can include buffer spans and line number ranges, as well as
the MIME type of the file:

  (\"/path/to/file\" :bounds ((start1 . end1) (start2 . end2) ...)
                   :lines  ((from1 . to1) (from2 . end2) ...)
                   :mime \"image/png\")

gptel tries to guess file MIME types, but is not always successful, so
it is recommended to provide it with non-text files.

Usage of context commands (such as `gptel-add' and `gptel-add-file')
will modify this variable.  You can also set this variable
buffer-locally, or let-bind it around calls to gptel queries, or via
gptel presets with the :context key."

(defun gptel-make-tool (&rest slots)
  "Make a gptel tool for LLM use.

The following keyword arguments are available, of which the first
four SLOTS are required.

NAME: The name of the tool, recommended to be in Javascript style snake_case.

FUNCTION: The function itself (lambda or symbol) that runs the tool.

DESCRIPTION: A verbose description of what the tool does, how to
call it and what it returns.

ARGS: A list of plists specifying the arguments, or nil for a function that
takes no arguments.  Each plist in ARGS requires the following keys:
- argument :name and :description, as strings.
- argument :type, as a symbol.  Allowed types are those understood by the JSON
  schema: string, number, integer, boolean, array, object or null

The following plist keys are conditional/optional:
- :optional, boolean indicating if argument is optional
- :enum for enumerated types, whose value is a vector of strings representing
  allowed values.  Note that :type is still required for enums.
- :items, if the :type is array.  Its value must be a plist including at least
  the item's :type.
- :properties, if the type is object.  Its value must be a plist that can be
  serialized into a JSON object specification by `json-serialize'.

ASYNC: boolean indicating if the elisp function is asynchronous.
If ASYNC is t, the function should take a callback as its first
argument, along with the arguments specified in ARGS, and run the
callback with the tool call result when it's ready.  The callback
itself is an implementation detail and must not be included in
ARGS.

The following keys are optional

CATEGORY: A string indicating a category for the tool.  This is
used only for grouping in gptel's UI.  Defaults to \"misc\".

CONFIRM: Whether the tool call should wait for the user to run it.  If
true, the user will be prompted with the proposed tool call, which can
be examined, accepted, deferred or canceled.  It can also be a function
that receives the same arguments as FUNCTION and returns true if the
user should be prompted.

INCLUDE: Whether the tool results should be included as part of
the LLM output.  This is useful for logging and as context for
subsequent requests in the same buffer.  This is primarily useful
in chat buffers.

Here is an example definition:

  (gptel-make-tool
   :function (lambda (location unit)
                (url-retrieve-synchronously \"api.weather.com/...\"
                                            location unit))
   :name \"get_weather\"
   :description \"Get the current weather in a given location\"
   :args (list \\='(:name \"location\"
                 :type string
                 :description \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\")
               \\='(:name \"unit\"
                 :type string
                 :enum [\"celsius\" \"farenheit\"]
                 :description
                 \"The unit of temperature, either \\='celsius\\=' or \\='fahrenheit\\='\"
                 :optional t)))

If the tool is asynchronous, the function is modified to take a
callback as its first argument, which it runs with the result:

   (lambda (callback location unit)
     (url-retrieve \"api.weather.com/...\"
                   (lambda (_)
                     (let ((result (parse-this-buffer)))

  "Request a response from the `gptel-backend' for PROMPT.

The request is asynchronous, this function returns immediately.

If PROMPT is
- a string, it is used to create a full prompt suitable for
  sending to the LLM.
- A list of strings, it is interpreted as a conversation, i.e. a
  series of alternating user prompts and LLM responses.
  (\"user msg 1\" \"llm msg 1\" \"user msg 2\" \"llm msg 2\" ...)
- nil but region is active, the region contents are used.
- nil, the current buffer's contents up to (point) are used.
  Previous responses from the LLM are identified as responses.

Keyword arguments:

CALLBACK, if supplied, is a function of two arguments, called
with the RESPONSE (usually a string) and INFO (a plist):

 (funcall CALLBACK RESPONSE INFO)

RESPONSE is

- A string if the request was successful
- nil if there was no response or an error.

These are the only two cases you typically need to consider,
unless you need to clean up after aborted requests, use LLM
tools, handle \"reasoning\" content specially or stream
responses (see STREAM).  In these cases, RESPONSE can be

- The symbol `abort' if the request is aborted, see `gptel-abort'.

- A cons cell of the form

  (tool-call . ((TOOL ARGS CB) ...))

  where TOOL is a gptel-tool struct, ARGS is a plist of
  arguments, and CB is a function for handling the results.  You
  can call CB with the result of calling the tool to continue the
  request.

- A cons cell of the form

  (tool-result . ((TOOL ARGS RESULT) ...))

  where TOOL is a gptel-tool struct, ARGS is a plist of
  arguments, and RESULT was returned from calling the tool
  function.

- A cons cell of the form

  (reasoning . text)

  where text is the contents of the reasoning block.  (Also see
  STREAM if you are using streaming.)

See `gptel--insert-response' for an example callback handling all
cases.

The INFO plist has (at least) the following keys:
:data         - The request data included with the query
:position     - marker at the point the request was sent, unless
                POSITION is specified.
:buffer       - The buffer current when the request was sent,
                unless BUFFER is specified.
:status       - Short string describing the result of the request,
                including possible HTTP errors.

Example of a callback that messages the user with the response
and info:

 (lambda (response info)
  (if (stringp response)
      (let ((posn (marker-position (plist-get info :position)))
            (buf  (buffer-name (plist-get info :buffer))))
        (message \"Response for request from %S at %d: %s\"
                 buf posn response))
    (message \"gptel-request failed with message: %s\"
             (plist-get info :status))))

Or, for just the response:

 (lambda (response _)
  ;; Do something with response
  (message (rot13-string response)))

If CALLBACK is omitted, the response is inserted at the point the
request was sent.

STREAM is a boolean that determines if the response should be
streamed, as in `gptel-stream'.  If the model or the backend does
not support streaming, this will be ignored.

When streaming responses

- CALLBACK will be called repeatedly with each RESPONSE text
  chunk (a string) as it is received.
- When the HTTP request ends successfully, CALLBACK will be
  called with a RESPONSE argument of t to indicate success.
- Similarly, CALLBACK will be called with
  (reasoning . text-chunk) for each reasoning chunk, and
  (reasoning . t) to indicate the end of the reasoning block.

BUFFER and POSITION are the buffer and position (integer or
marker) at which the response is inserted.  If a CALLBACK is
specified, no response is inserted and these arguments are
ignored, but they are still available in the INFO plist passed
to CALLBACK for you to use.

BUFFER defaults to the current buffer, and POSITION to the value
of (point) or (region-end), depending on whether the region is
active.

CONTEXT is any additional data needed for the callback to run. It
is included in the INFO argument to the callback.
Note: This is intended for storing Emacs state to be used by
CALLBACK, and unrelated to the context supplied to the LLM.

SYSTEM is the system message or extended chat directive sent to
the LLM.  This can be a string, a list of strings or a function
that returns either; see `gptel-directives' for more
information. If SYSTEM is omitted, the value of
`gptel--system-message' for the current buffer is used.

The following keywords are mainly for internal use:

IN-PLACE is a boolean used by the default callback when inserting
the response to determine if delimiters are needed between the
prompt and the response.

If DRY-RUN is non-nil, do not send the request.  Construct and
return a state machine object that can be introspected and
resumed.

TRANSFORMS is a list of functions used to transform the prompt or query
parameters dynamically.  Each function is called in a temporary buffer
containing the prompt to be sent, and can conditionally modify this
buffer.  This can include changing the (buffer-local) values of the
model, backend or system prompt, or augmenting the prompt with
additional information (such as from a RAG engine).

- Synchronous transformers are called with zero or one argument, the
  state machine for the request.

- Asynchronous transformers are called with two arguments, a callback
  and the state machine.  It should run the callback after finishing its
  transformation.

See `gptel-prompt-transform-functions' for more.

If provided, SCHEMA forces the LLM to generate JSON output.  Its value
is a JSON schema, which can be provided as
- an elisp object, a nested plist structure.
- A JSON schema serialized to a string
- A shorthand object/array description, see `gptel--dispatch-schema-type'.
See the manual or the wiki for examples.

Note: SCHEMA is presently experimental and subject to change, and not
all providers support structured output.

FSM is the state machine driving the request.  This can be used
to define a custom request control flow, see `gptel-fsm' for
details.  You can safely ignore this -- FSM is an unstable
feature and subject to change.

Note:

1. This function is not fully self-contained.  Consider
let-binding the parameters `gptel-backend', `gptel-model',
`gptel-use-tools' and `gptel-use-context' around calls to it as
required.

2. The return value of this function is a state machine that may
be used to rerun or continue the request at a later time."
