**NOTE**: please update gptel and test before reporting a bug.  Chances are it's been fixed already.

**Describe the bug**
A short description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
How I can reproduce the behavior.

**Logging and/or simulation**
Depending on the bug, it might be relevant to include the data gptel sends and receives from the LLM, or simulate a request.

To see gptel's log,
1. Turn on logging by running `(setq gptel-log-level 'info)` (or `'debug`)
2. Use gptel
3. Check the `*gptel-log*` buffer

For a gptel request dry-run,
1. Run `(setq gptel-expert-commands t)`
2. From gptel's menu (`M-x gptel-menu`), use one of the newly visible `dry run` options.

**Backtrace**
If Emacs throws an error, please generate a backtrace as follows:
1. Run `M-x toggle-debug-on-error`
2. Reproduce the error
3. Paste the contents of the backtrace here
