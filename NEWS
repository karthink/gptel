* 0.9.9-pre

** New models and backends

- Add support for ~gemini-2.5-pro~, ~gemini-2.5-flash~,
  ~gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17~.

** New features and UI changes

- gptel now handles Ollama models that return both reasoning content
  and tool calls in a single request.

* 0.9.8.5 2025-06-11

** Breaking changes

- ~gptel-org-branching-context~ is now a global variable.  It was
  buffer-local by default in past releases.

- The following models have been removed from the default ChatGPT backend:
  - ~o1-preview~: use ~o1~ instead.
  - ~gpt-4-turbo-preview~: use ~gpt-4o~ or ~gpt-4-turbo~ instead.
  - ~gpt-4-32k~, ~gpt-4-0125-preview~ and ~gpt-4-1106-preview~: use
    ~gpt-4o~ or ~gpt-4~ instead.
  Alternatively, you can add these models back to the backend in your
  personal configuration:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (push 'gpt-4-turbo-preview
        (gptel-backend-models (gptel-get-backend "ChatGPT")))
  #+end_src

- Only relevant if you use ~gptel-request~ in your elisp code,
  /interactive gptel usage is unaffected/: ~gptel-request~ now takes a
  new, optional =:transforms= argument.  Any prompt modifications
  (like adding context to requests) must now be specified via this
  argument.  See the definition of ~gptel-send~ for an example.

** New models and backends

- Add support for ~gpt-4.1~, ~gpt-4.1-mini~, ~gpt-4.1-nano~, ~o3~ and
  ~o4-mini~.

- Add support for ~gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25~,
  ~gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17~, ~gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06~ and
  ~gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05~.

- Add support for ~claude-sonnet-4-20250514~ and
  ~claude-opus-4-20250514~.

- Add support for AWS Bedrock models.  You can create an AWS Bedrock
  gptel backend with ~gptel-make-bedrock~, which see.  Please note:
  AWS Bedrock support requires Curl 8.5.0 or higher.

- You can now create an xAI backend with ~gptel-make-xai~, which see.
  (xAI was supported before but the model configuration is now handled
  for you by this function.)

- Add support for GitHub Copilot Chat.  See the README and
  ~gptel-make-gh-copilot~.  Please note: this is only the chat
  component of GitHub Copilot.  Copilot's ~completion-at-point~
  (tab-completion) functionality is not supported by gptel.

- Add support for Sambanova.  This is an OpenAI-compatible API so you
  can create a backend with ~gptel-make-openai~, see the README for
  details.

- Add support for Mistral Le Chat.  This is an an OpenAI-compatible
  API so you can create a backend with ~gptel-make-openai~, see the
  README for details.

** New features and UI changes

- gptel now supports handling reasoning/thinking blocks in responses
  from Gemini models.  This is controlled by
  ~gptel-include-reasoning~, in the same way that it handles other
  APIs.

- The new option ~gptel-curl-extra-args~ can be used to specify extra
  arguments to the Curl command used for the request.  This is the
  global version of the gptel-backend-specific ~:curl-args~ slot,
  which can be used to specify Curl arguments when using a specific
  backend.

- Tools now run in the buffer from which the request originates.  This
  can be significant when tools read or manipulate Emacs' state.

- gptel can access MCP server tools by integrating with the mcp.el
  package, which is at https://github.com/lizqwerscott/mcp.el.
  (mcp.el is available on MELPA.)  To help with the integration, two
  new commands are provided: ~gptel-mcp-connect~ and
  ~gptel-mcp-disconnect~.  You can use these to start MCP servers
  selectively and add tools to gptel.  These commands are also
  available from gptel's tools menu.
  
  These commands are currently not autoloaded by gptel.  To access
  them, require the ~gptel-integrations~ feature.

- You can now define "presets", which are a bundle of gptel options,
  such as the backend, model, system message, included tools,
  temperature and so on.  This set of options can be applied together,
  making it easy to switch between different tasks using gptel.  From
  gptel's transient menu, you can save the current configuration as a
  preset or apply another one.  Presets can be applied globally,
  buffer-locally or for the next request only.  To persist presets
  across Emacs sessions, define presets in your configuration using
  ~gptel-make-preset~.

- When using ~gptel-send~ from anywhere in Emacs, you can now include
  a "cookie" of the form =@preset-name= in the prompt text to apply
  that preset before sending.  The preset is applied for that request
  only.  This is an easy way to specify models, tools, system
  messages (etc) on the fly.  In chat buffers the preset cookie is
  fontified and available for completion via ~completion-at-point~.

- For scripting purposes, provide a ~gptel-with-preset~ macro to
  create an environment with a preset applied.

- Links to plain-text files in chat buffers can be followed, and their
  contents included with the request.  Using Org or Markdown links is
  an easy, intuitive, persistent and buffer-local way to specify
  context.  To enable this behavior, turn on ~gptel-track-media~. This
  is a pre-existing option that also controls whether image/document
  links are followed and sent (when the model supports it).

- A new hook ~gptel-prompt-transform-functions~ is provided for
  arbitrary transformations of the prompt prior to sending a request.
  This hook runs in a temporary buffer containing the text to be sent.
  Any aspect of the request (the text, destination, request
  parameters, response handling preferences) can be modified
  buffer-locally here.  These hook functions can be asynchronous.

- The user option ~gptel-use-curl~ can now be used to specify a Curl
  path.

- The current kill can be added to gptel's context.  To enable this,
  turn on ~gptel-expert-commands~ and use gptel's transient menu. 

- The tools menu (~gptel-tools~) has been redesigned.  It now displays
  tool categories and associated tools in two columns, and it should
  scale better to any number of tools.  As a bonus, the new menu
  requires half as many keystrokes as before to enable individual
  tools or toggle categories.

** Notable Bug fixes

- Fix more Org markup conversion edge cases involving nested Markdown
  delimiters.

* 0.9.8 2025-03-13

Version 0.9.8 adds support for new Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI,
Perplexity, and DeepSeek models, introduces LLM tool use/function
calling, a redesign of ~gptel-menu~, includes new customization hooks,
dry-run options and refined settings, improvements to the rewrite
feature and control of LLM "reasoning" content.

** Breaking changes

- ~gemini-pro~ has been removed from the list of Gemini models, as
  this model is no longer supported by the Gemini API.

- Sending an active region in Org mode will now apply Org
  mode-specific rules to the text, such as branching context.

- The following obsolete variables and functions have been removed:
  - ~gptel-send-menu~: Use ~gptel-menu~ instead.
  - ~gptel-host~: Use ~gptel-make-openai~ instead.
  - ~gptel-playback~: Use ~gptel-stream~ instead.
  - ~gptel--debug~: Use ~gptel-log-level~ instead.

** New models and backends

- Add support for several new Gemini models including
  ~gemini-2.0-flash~, ~gemini-2.0-pro-exp~ and
  ~gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp~, among others.

- Add support for the Anthropic model ~claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219~,
  including its "reasoning" output.

- Add support for OpenAI's ~o1~, ~o3-mini~ and ~gpt-4.5-preview~
  models.

- Add support for Perplexity.  While gptel supported Perplexity in
  earlier releases by reusing its OpenAI support, there is now first
  class support for the Perplexity API, including citations.

- Add support for DeepSeek.  While gptel supported DeepSeek in earlier
  releases by reusing its OpenAI support, there is now first class
  support for the DeepSeek API, including support for handling
  "reasoning" output.

** New features and UI changes

- ~gptel-rewrite~ now supports iterating on responses.

- gptel supports the ability to simulate/dry-run requests so you can
  see exactly what will be sent.  This payload preview can now be
  edited in place and the request continued.

- Directories can now be added to gptel's global context.  Doing so
  will add all files in the directory recursively.

- "Oneshot" settings: when using gptel's Transient menus, request
  parameters, directives and tools can now be set for the next request
  only in addition to globally across the Emacs session and
  buffer-locally.  This is useful for making one-off requests with
  different settings.

- ~gptel-mode~ can now be used in all modes derived from ~text-mode~.

- gptel now tries to handle LLM responses that are in mixed
  Org/Markdown markup correctly.

- Add ~gptel-org-convert-response~ to toggle the automatic conversion
  of (possibly) Markdown-formatted LLM responses to Org markup where
  appropriate.

- You can now look up registered gptel backends using the
  ~gptel-get-backend~ function.  This is intended to make scripting
  and configuring gptel easier.  ~gptel-get-backend~ is a generalized
  variable so you can (un)set backends with ~setf~.

- Tool use: gptel now supports LLM tool use, or function calling.
  Essentially you can equip the LLM with capabilities (such as
  filesystem access, web search, control of Emacs or introspection of
  Emacs' state and more) that it can use to perform tasks for you.
  gptel runs these tools using argument values provided by the LLMs.
  This requires specifying tools, which are elisp functions with plain
  text descriptions of their arguments and results.  gptel does not
  include any tools out of the box yet.

- You can look up registered gptel tools using the ~gptel-get-tool~
  function.  This is intended to make scripting and configuring gptel
  easier.  ~gptel-get-tool~ is a generalized variable so you can
  (un)set tools with ~setf~.

- New hooks for customization:
  + ~gptel-prompt-filter-hook~ runs in a temporary buffer containing
    the text to be sent, before the full query is created.  It can be
    used for arbitrary text transformations to the source text.
  + ~gptel-post-request-hook~ runs after the request is sent, and
    (possibly) before any response is received.  This is intended for
    preparatory/reset code.
  + ~gptel-post-rewrite-hook~ runs after a ~gptel-rewrite~ request is
    successfully and fully received.

- ~gptel-menu~ has been redesigned.  It now shows a verbose
  description of what will be sent and where the output will go.  This
  is intended to provide clarity on gptel's default prompting
  behavior, as well as the effect of the various prompt/response
  redirection it provides.  Incompatible combinations of options are
  now disallowed.

- The spacing between the end of the prompt and the beginning of the
  response in buffers is now customizable via
  ~gptel-response-separator~, and can be any string.

- ~gptel-context-remove-all~ is now an interactive command.

- gptel now handles "reasoning" content produced by LLMs.  Some LLMs
  include in their response a "thinking" or "reasoning" section.  This
  text improves the quality of the LLM’s final output, but may not be
  interesting to you by itself.  The new user option
  ~gptel-include-reasoning~ controls whether and how gptel displays
  this content.

- (Anthropic API only) Some LLM backends can cache content sent to it
  by gptel, so that only the newly included part of the text needs to
  be processed on subsequent conversation turns.  This results in
  faster and significantly cheaper processing. The new user option
  ~gptel-cache~ can be used to specify caching preferences for
  prompts, the system message and/or tool definitions.  This is
  supported only by the Anthropic API right now.

- (Org mode) Org property drawers are now stripped from the prompt
  text before sending queries.  You can control this behavior or
  specify additional Org elements to ignore via
  ~gptel-org-ignore-elements~.  (For more complex pre-processing you
  can use ~gptel-prompt-filter-hook~.)

** Notable Bug fixes

- Fix response mix-up when running concurrent requests in Org mode
  buffers.
- gptel now works around an Org fontification bug where streaming
  responses in Org mode buffers sometimes caused source code blocks to
  remain unfontified.

* 0.9.7 2024-12-04

Version 0.9.7 adds dynamic directives, a better rewrite interface,
streaming support to the gptel request API, and more flexible
model/backend configuration.

** Breaking changes
~gptel-rewrite-menu~ has been obsoleted.  Use ~gptel-rewrite~ instead.

** Backends
- Add support for OpenAI's ~o1-preview~ and ~o1-mini~.

- Add support for Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Haiku.

- Add support for xAI.

- Add support for Novita AI.

** New features and UI changes

- gptel's directives (see ~gptel-directives~) can now be dynamic, and
  include more than the system message.  You can "pre-fill" a
  conversation with canned user/LLM messages.  Directives can now be
  functions that dynamically generate the system message and
  conversation history based on the current context.  This paves the
  way for fully flexible task-specific templates, which the UI does
  not yet support in full.

- gptel's rewrite interface has been reworked.  If using a streaming
  endpoint, the rewritten text is streamed in as a preview placed over
  the original.  In all cases, clicking on the preview brings up a
  dispatch you can use to easily diff, ediff, merge, accept or reject
  the changes (4ae9c1b2), and you can configure gptel to run one of
  these actions automatically.  See the README for examples.

- ~gptel-abort~, used to cancel requests in progress, now works across
  the board, including when not using Curl or with ~gptel-rewrite~.

- The ~gptel-request~ API now explicitly supports streaming responses
  , making it easy to write your own helpers or features with
  streaming support.  The API also supports ~gptel-abort~ to stop and
  clean up responses.

- You can now unset the system message -- different from setting it to
  an empty string.  gptel will also automatically disable the system
  message when using models that don't support it.

- Support for including PDFs with requests to Anthropic models has
  been added.  (These queries are cached, so you pay only 10% of the
  token cost of the PDF in follow-up queries.)  Note that document
  support (PDFs etc) for Gemini models has been available since
  v0.9.5.

- When defining a gptel model or backend, you can specify arbitrary
  parameters to be sent with each request.  This includes the (many)
  API options across all APIs that gptel does not yet provide explicit
  support for.

- New transient command option to easily remove all included context
  chunks.

** Notable Bug fixes
- Pressing ~RET~ on included files in the context inspector buffer now
  pops up the file correctly.
- API keys are stripped of whitespace before sending.
- Multiple UI, backend and prompt construction bugs have been fixed.
